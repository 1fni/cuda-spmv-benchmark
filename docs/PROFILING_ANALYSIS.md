# Profiling Analysis: Why Stencil Specialization Wins

This document explains **why** the custom CG solver outperforms NVIDIA AmgX, using profiling data from Nsight Systems and Nsight Compute.

## Executive Summary

| Finding | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| AmgX spends **48% of compute time** in generic CSR SpMV | Primary optimization target |
| Custom stencil kernel achieves **2× higher throughput** | Eliminates index indirection |
| Stencil-aware halo exchange: **160 KB per neighbor** | Minimal communication overhead |
| Overall solver speedup: **1.40× single-GPU, 1.44× multi-GPU** | Consistent advantage at scale |

**Key insight**: By exploiting the known 5-point stencil structure, the custom solver eliminates memory indirections and minimizes communication, translating kernel-level gains into solver-level performance.

## 1. Kernel Distribution (Single-GPU)

### AmgX Kernel Breakdown (10k×10k, 1 GPU)

| Kernel Type | Time % | Notes |
|-------------|-------:|-------|
| cuSPARSE CSR SpMV | 48% | Generic sparse matrix-vector multiply |
| AXPY | 19% | Vector addition |
| Dot product | 10% | Inner product reductions |
| AXPBY | 9% | Scaled vector operations |
| Other | 14% | Setup, synchronization, etc. |

### Custom CG Kernel Breakdown (10k×10k, 4 GPUs)

| Kernel Type | Time % | Notes |
|-------------|-------:|-------|
| Stencil SpMV | 41% | Structure-aware kernel |
| AXPY | 29% | Vector addition |
| Dot product (cuBLAS) | 16% | cuBLAS ddot |
| AXPBY | 13% | Scaled vector operations |
| Reduce | <1% | MPI reductions |

### Observation

SpMV dominates in both implementations (~40-50% of total time), making it the primary optimization target. The custom kernel's 2× speedup on this operation drives the overall solver improvement.

## 2. SpMV Kernel Analysis

### Why Stencil Kernels Are Faster

The 5-point stencil discretization produces a sparse matrix with a **predictable structure**:

```
     [N]
      |
[W]--[C]--[E]
      |
     [S]
```

Each interior row has exactly 5 non-zeros at fixed offsets: `-grid_size`, `-1`, `0`, `+1`, `+grid_size`.

**Generic CSR (cuSPARSE)**:
- Must read `col_idx[]` array for every non-zero
- Indirect memory accesses → cache misses
- Cannot predict next memory location

**Stencil-aware kernel (custom)**:
- Column indices computed from row index (no lookup)
- Grouped memory accesses: W-C-E (stride-1) before N-S (stride grid_size)
- 95% of rows use fast path (interior points)

### Measured Performance (A100 80GB)

| Implementation | Time (20k×20k) | Bandwidth | Speedup |
|----------------|---------------:|-----------:|--------:|
| cuSPARSE CSR | 26.77 ms | 1195 GB/s | baseline |
| Stencil kernel | 12.86 ms | 2364 GB/s | **2.08×** |

### Roofline Analysis (Nsight Compute)

Profiled on RTX 4060 Laptop GPU (7k×7k matrix, same relative behavior):

</p>

| Kernel | Duration | Memory Throughput | Performance |
|--------|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| cuSPARSE CSR | 22.99 ms | 67% | 21.3 GFLOP/s |
| Custom Stencil | 11.25 ms | **95%** | **43.6 GFLOP/s** |

**Key observations:**
- Both kernels are **memory-bound** (positioned on the sloped part of the roofline)
- Stencil achieves **95% memory throughput** vs 67% for CSR
- The 2× speedup comes from better memory system utilization, not more compute
- CSR's index indirection creates irregular access patterns that reduce effective bandwidth

### Arithmetic Intensity Analysis

Both kernels are memory-bound, but the stencil kernel achieves higher effective bandwidth:

| Metric | CSR | Stencil |
|--------|----:|--------:|
| Bytes per row | 88 B | 48 B |
| (5 values + 5 indices + 1 x + 1 y) | | (5 values + 1 x + 1 y, no indices) |
| Arithmetic intensity | 0.11 FLOP/B | 0.21 FLOP/B |

The stencil kernel moves **45% less data** per row by eliminating index storage and lookups.

## 3. Multi-GPU Scaling Analysis

### Communication Pattern Comparison

| Aspect | Custom CG | AmgX |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Halo exchange | 160 KB per neighbor | Generic CSR pattern |
| Method | MPI explicit staging | Internal NCCL/MPI |
| Overlap | Partial compute/comm | Internal optimization |

### Why 160 KB?

For a 10k×10k grid partitioned across 8 GPUs:
- Each GPU owns ~12,500 rows
- Halo zone = 1 row = 10,000 doubles = 80 KB
- Two neighbors (top + bottom) = 160 KB total

Compare to naive AllGather: 100M doubles × 8 bytes = 800 MB (5000× more data).

### Scaling Efficiency

| GPUs | Custom CG | AmgX | Notes |
|-----:|----------:|-----:|-------|
| 1 | baseline | baseline | 1.40× faster (custom) |
| 2 | 1.95× | 1.94× | Near-linear scaling |
| 4 | 3.82× | 3.76× | Maintained advantage |
| 8 | 6.94× | 6.99× | Similar efficiency |

Both implementations scale well, but the custom solver **maintains its single-GPU advantage** at every scale.

## Speedup Attribution

Based on profiling data and theoretical analysis:

| Source | Contribution | Evidence |
|--------|-------------:|----------|
| SpMV kernel (stencil vs CSR) | ~70% | 2× throughput, 48% of AmgX time |
| Stencil-aware halo exchange | ~20% | 160 KB vs generic patterns |
| Memory layout optimization | ~10% | Better coalescing in BLAS1 ops |

### Theoretical vs Observed

Using Amdahl's Law with SpMV = 48% of time and 2× speedup:
```
Theoretical speedup = 1 / (0.48/2 + 0.52) = 1 / 0.76 = 1.32×
```

Observed speedup (1.40×) exceeds theoretical, suggesting:
- SpMV improvement closer to 2.5× in solver context
- Secondary gains from improved memory access patterns in BLAS operations

## Conclusions

1. **SpMV is the bottleneck**: 48% of AmgX time, making kernel optimization high-impact

2. **Structure exploitation works**: Eliminating index indirection yields 2× SpMV speedup

3. **Gains compound at scale**: Single-GPU advantage (1.40×) maintained through 8 GPUs (1.44×)

4. **Not a limitation of AmgX**: AmgX correctly handles arbitrary sparse matrices; the performance gap reflects the value of specialization when problem structure is known
